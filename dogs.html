<h3> Why are dogs so cute?</h3>
<p>Why are dog so cute they're so
 cute because most of them are
furry, and people love the
 tactile feel of soft fur or
 silky hair. They often have
 a very attractive coloring
 that pleases the eye. And
 when they want  something
  they get what they want
 by begging and when they
cry.</p>
